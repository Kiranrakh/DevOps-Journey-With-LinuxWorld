How to Add More Terminals and GUI Interfaces in Linux

Linux allows you to customize your terminal (command line interface) and desktop environment (GUI) to enhance your workflow and experience. This guide explains how to install different terminals and desktop environments easily.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Adding More Terminals (Command Line Apps)

A terminal is where you type commands in Linux. While Linux comes with a default terminal, you can install more feature-rich options.

Installing a New Terminal

To install a different terminal, use the package manager:

Tilix (Advanced terminal with tabs & tiles)

sudo apt install tilix

Alacritty (Fast and smooth terminal)

sudo apt install alacritty

Kitty (Customizable & lightweight terminal)

sudo apt install kitty

How to Open the New Terminal

After installation, simply type the name of the terminal in your current terminal and press Enter:

tilix  # or alacritty, kitty

2Ô∏è‚É£ Adding More GUI Interfaces (Desktop Environments)

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is your desktop environment. Linux allows you to switch between different desktop environments (DEs) based on your preference.

Installing a New Desktop Environment

To install a different DE, run the corresponding command:

GNOME (Modern & easy to use)

sudo apt install gnome-session

KDE Plasma (Highly customizable & colorful)

sudo apt install kde-plasma-desktop

XFCE (Lightweight & fast)

sudo apt install xfce4

LXQt (Very lightweight, best for old PCs)

sudo apt install lxqt

Switching to a New Desktop Environment

Log out of your current session.

At the login screen, look for a gear/settings icon (usually near the password box).

Select the new Desktop Environment you installed.

Log in, and your Linux desktop will change!

Reverting to the Previous GUI

If you want to switch back, log out again and select your previous environment from the gear/settings menu.
