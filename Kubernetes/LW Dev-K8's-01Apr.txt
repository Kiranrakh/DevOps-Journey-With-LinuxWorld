>> Ephemeral Storage (Temporary)
	  These storage types exist only as long as the pod is running. When the pod is deleted, the data is lost.

>> Persistent Storage (Long-term)
	  Persistent storage is required when data needs to survive beyond a podâ€™s lifecycle.

	>> Persistent Volume (PV) & Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
		- Persistent Volume (PV): Represents a piece of storage in the cluster (e.g., AWS 	  	  EBS, GCP Persistent Disk, NFS).

		- Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): Request for storage by a pod.
