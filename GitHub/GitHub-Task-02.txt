# Creating and Merging a New Branch into Main Branch

## Step 1: Check the Current Branch
Before creating a new branch, check the existing branches and the current branch.
```sh
git branch
```
The active branch will be highlighted with an asterisk (*).

## Step 2: Create a New Branch
To create a new branch, use the following command:
```sh
git branch new-feature
```
This creates a branch named `new-feature`.

## Step 3: Switch to the New Branch
Move to the new branch:
```sh
git checkout new-feature
```
Alternatively, you can use:
```sh
git switch new-feature
```

## Step 4: Make Changes and Commit
1. Modify or create a new file.
2. Add the changes to Git:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
3. Commit the changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Added a new feature"
   ```

## Step 5: Merge the New Branch into the Main Branch
1. Switch back to the main branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   ```
2. Merge the `new-feature` branch into `main`:
   ```sh
   git merge new-feature
   ```
   If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them before proceeding.

## Step 6: Push the Changes to GitHub
1. Push the updated main branch to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Delete the merged branch (optional):
   ```sh
   git branch -d new-feature
   ```

### ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have successfully created and merged a new branch into the main branch.
